## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ img/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ global.scss
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` / `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where we like to put components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

[Content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) are placed here and registered in the `src/content/config.ts`.

If you need to load a custom icon from an svg. You can place it inside `/src/assets/icons`.
For more information visit the documentation for the [astro-icon](https://www.astroicon.dev/) package.

## Content

### Navigation

Navigation structure is implemented within `/src/components/Header.astro`.

### Content Grid Layout

The Content in this Example is structured and contained with a layout Breakout method.
You can find the definition in `/src/styles/base/_content.scss`.

This pattern exposes a limitation. We loose the ability to float elements.
For example, you can not float an image on the side and wrap some text around it.

If you create pages with the `/src/layouts/DefaultLayout.astro` all sections will always by default have a max-width of 70rem or 1120px. You can change this inside `/src/styles/global.scss` with the `--max-content-width` variable.

### Content Elements

TBD
